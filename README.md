# 🚖 Crypto Commute

**Crypto Commute** is a decentralized ride-hailing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to revolutionize urban transportation by providing secure, transparent, and autonomous ride-sharing services. This platform enables users to book rides, make payments, and engage with drivers through a blockchain-based infrastructure.

## 🌐 Overview

Crypto Commute leverages blockchain technology to offer a peer-to-peer ride-sharing experience. By utilizing Ethereum smart contracts, the platform ensures that all transactions—including ride bookings and payments—are secure and immutable. Riders and drivers can interact seamlessly with the platform, knowing that their data is protected and all transactions are transparent.

Key features of Crypto Commute include:
- **Decentralized Ride Booking**: Riders and drivers connect directly without the need for intermediaries.
- **Smart Contract Payments**: All transactions are handled through Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Immutable Ride History**: Every ride is recorded on the blockchain, providing an auditable trail of all interactions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- ⚛️ **ReactJS**: Frontend library for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- 🧩 **Chakra UI**: Provides pre-built, customizable components for consistent UI design.
- 🌐 **Web3.js**: Allows interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating smart contract execution and blockchain transactions.
- 🏠 **Nest.js**: Server-side application framework for building scalable backend services.
- 🔮 **Alchemy**: Provides blockchain infrastructure and development tools for building decentralized applications (DApps).
- 🗺️ **Google Maps API**: Enables dynamic map integration and location services for ride coordination.
- 🛠️ **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- 🔌 **Socket.io**: Supports real-time communication between the server and clients.
- 📦 **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user, driver, and vehicle data.
- 🌬️ **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs efficiently.

## 🔧 Features

1. **Blockchain Layer**  
   The core of Crypto Commute is its blockchain layer, which is responsible for ride bookings, payments, and driver allocation through Ethereum smart contracts. The blockchain guarantees security and transparency by maintaining an immutable ledger of all transactions.

2. **Payment Layer**  
   Once a ride is completed, the payment layer initiates the transaction settlement between the rider and the driver. Secure transactions are processed using MetaMask, with funds being transferred via Ethereum smart contracts.

3. **Database Layer**  
   Crypto Commute uses MongoDB for storing essential user and driver data, providing a flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution. Efficient data management practices like indexing and replication ensure high performance and data integrity.
